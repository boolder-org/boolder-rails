# Boolder Rails

Boolder is the best way to discover bouldering in Fontainebleau. 

This is the code powering the [Boolder website](https://www.boolder.com) and all the backend & data processing.

NB: if you just want a quick access to the data, check out [boolder-data](https://github.com/boolder-org/boolder-data)

### Mapbox credentials

- Create an account on https://www.mapbox.com. 
- Go to the [Tokens]([url](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)) page and create a public token with all the public `scopes` (or just use the default token).
- Back in the Rails app, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out `MAPBOX_DEV_ACCESS_KEY` with your token

### Optional: JOSM

Josm is an open source tool used by the OpenStreetMap community.
We use it to edit GeoJSON files.

- Click on the checkbox next to `Fastdraw` and `PicLayer`, and then click on OK
- Restart Josm
- In the menu bar (on the left), click on `Fast Drawing mode` and then type `Q` to enter the options dialog. Click on `Draw closed polygons only`, choose `3` for `Starting Epsilon` and `Simplify with initial epsilon` for `Enter key mode`
