        equipment: 
          title: Equipment
          intro: Here is the equipment you will need to climb outdoors.
          shoes: Climbing shoes
          shoes_tip: "Tip: use shoes 1 (or 2) sizes below what you normally wear, to better stick to the boulder. Your toes will hurt a bit but it's worth it!"
          crashpad: A crash mat
          crashpad_description: A crash mat is designed to soften your fall.
          crashpad_tip: We recommend you use a thick one with a large surface, even if it's a bit more bulky.
          guidebook: A guidebook
          guidebook_description_html: A guidebook (or <i>topo</i> in French), will help you navigate climbing areas.
          guidebook_tip_html: We recommend you use <a href="%{path}">the Boolder app</a>, available on iPhone. You will have access to a GPS map and photos of the problems.
          guidebook_tip2: If you prefer a paper version, we recommend using Fun Bloc.
          optional: Optional
          optional_item1_html: a <strong>doormat</strong> (or a rag), to clean your shoes before starting a problem
          optional_item2_html: <strong>additional crash mats</strong>, see <a href="%{path}">“Climb safely”</a>
          optional_item3_html: some <strong>chalk</strong> for your hands to better stick to the boulder
          optional_item4_html: a <strong>soft brush</strong> to clean the rock and remove chalk marks
          warning_chalk_html: Don't use too much chalk, as it damages the rock (see <a href="%{path}" class="">“Rules”</a>).
          other_tips: Also, feel free to take a sports outfit that doesn't restrict your movements too much, and some food and water.

          title: Choose an area
          level: Adapted to your level
          level_p1_html: For your first bouldering session in Fontainebleau we recommend you choose an area with lots of problems <strong>graded between 2 and 3</strong>, with <strong>low boulders</strong> (below 3m), and with <strong>good landings</strong>.
          level_p2: This way you will be able to start bouldering with confidence, and find the type of problems you like.
          level_p3: "Here are a few areas that are perfect for beginners:"
          see_also: "See also:"
          other_levels: intermediate/advanced levels.
          easy_access: Easy access
          easy_access_p1: Anticipate to walk between 1 and 20 minutes to get to the first boulders from the parking spot, depending on the area.
          easy_access_p2: To avoid surprises, have a look at the map of the area.
          quiet: Quiet
          quiet_p1: Areas that are easy to access are generally pretty crowded, especially during the week-end.
          quiet_p2: If you prefer a more peaceful setting, try an area that is less accessible.

          title: Choose problems
          intro: Once you get to a bouldering area, here are a few tips to easily find problems adapted to you.
          filter_by_level: Filter by level
          filter_by_level_p1_html: Thanks to the <a href="%{path}">Boolder app</a>, you can filter problems that match with your level.
          filter_by_level_p2: This way you can identify the zones with a good density of problems adapted to your level.
          circuit: Follow a circuit
          circuit_p1: Circuits are a series of boulders of (relatively) homogeneous level, with ascending numbers.
          circuit_p2: Each problem is represented by a colored number and an arrow, painted directly on the boulder.
          circuit_p3: There are 5 main colors (yellow, orange, blue, red, and white/black) that correspond to increasing grades.
          circuit_p4_html: By following a <strong>yellow circuit</strong> (or an orange one) you'll be able to discover problems graded between 1 and 3, which is perfect to start.
          circuit_p5_html: "Tip: you can also filter by circuit with the <a href='%{path}'>Boolder app</a>"

          title: Climb safely
          intro: Here are a few tips to decrease the risks of injury.
          avoid_risky_problems: Avoid risky problems
          avoid_risky_problems_p1_html: As a beginner, prefer problems that are <strong>less than 3 or 4 meters high</strong> and with a <strong>good landing</strong> (even ground, with no rocks/roots/etc)
          height: "Height:"
          good_landing: Landing on even ground (sand)
          bad_landing: Difficult landing
          safe: Perfect to climb with confidence
          unsafe: To avoid
          multi_crashpad: Take several crash mats
          multi_crashpad_p1: It can be reassuring to have several crash mats to cover a larger surface on the ground.
          multi_crashpad_p2: If you climb with a group, you can also ask your friends to move the crash mat while you're climbing, so that it always stays right below you.
          spot: Spot
          spot_p1_html: To help your friends climb safely, you can offer to be the <i>spotter</i>.
          spot_p2: The spotter redirects the climber's fall to land safely on the crash mat.
          spot_p3: "Careful: don't try to catch the climber yourself, you migh injure yourself!"
          descent: Anticipate the descent
          descent_p1: It can sometimes be tricky to go down from a boulder once you're on top. Check the descent beforehand — especially if you're alone!

        rules: 
          title: Rules to protect the forest
          intro: The Fontainebleau area is a unique and fragile environment. It is important to respect a few rules to protect it.
          chalk: Use chalk sparingly
          chalk_p1: Chalk damages the rock, so use it sparingly. You can instead clean the rock (with a soft brush) to increase friction.
          chalk_p2: When you're done, don't forget to brush the holds (still with a soft brush) to remove any trace.
          clean_shoes: Clean your shoes
          clean_shoes_p1: Sand and dirt under your shoes contribute to polish the rock, which damages it in the long run.
          clean_shoes_p2: Don't forget to clean your shoes with a doormat or a rug before you start climbing.
          other_rules: Other rules
          other_rules_item1: Don't climb on wet boulders (it causes damage)
          other_rules_item2: Don't camp, don't make any fire
          other_rules_item3: Take your trash with you (or any trash you may find on your way!)
