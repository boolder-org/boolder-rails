          guidebook_description_html: A guidebook (or <i>topo</i> in French), will help you navigate climbing areas.

          optional: And also

          title: Choose problems
          intro: Once you get to a bouldering area, here are a few tips to easily find problems adapted to you.
          filter_by_level: Filter by level
          filter_by_level_p1_html: Thanks to the <a href="%{path}">Boolder app</a>, you can filter problems that match with your level.
          filter_by_level_p2: This way you can identify the zones with a good density of problems adapted to your level.
          filter_by_level_warning: "Careful: the grade 4a in Wicklow is roughly equivalent to 5a elsewhere."
          filter_by_level_warning2: Don't overestimate yourself ;)
          sector: Follow a sector
          sector_p1: Sectors are a series of boulders of (relatively) homogeneous level, with ascending numbers.
          sector_p2: Each problem is represented by a colored number and an arrow, painted directly on the boulder.
          sector_p3: There are 5 main colors (yellow, orange, blue, red, and white/black) that correspond to increasing grades.
          sector_p4_html: By following a yellow sector (or an orange one) you'll be able to discover problems graded between 1 and 3, which is perfect to start.
          sector_p5_html: "Tip: pick a <strong>sector suited for beginners</strong>, marked with a "
          sector_p6_html: They offer lots of easy problems (graded 1, 2 or 3), with low boulders (less than 3 meters high) and with good landings.

        climb_safely: 
          title: Climb safely
          intro: Here are a few tips to decrease the risks of injury.
          avoid_risky_problems: Avoid risky problems
          avoid_risky_problems_p1_html: As a beginner, prefer problems that are <strong>less than 3 or 4 meters high</strong> and with a <strong>good landing</strong> (even ground, with no rocks/roots/etc)
          height: "Height:"
          good_landing: Landing on even ground (sand)
          bad_landing: Difficult landing
          safe: Perfect to climb with confidence
          unsafe: To avoid
          multi_crashpad: Take several crash mats
          multi_crashpad_p1: It can be reassuring to have several crash mats to cover a larger surface on the ground.
          multi_crashpad_p2: If you climb with a group, you can also ask your friends to move the crash mat while you're climbing, so that it always stays right below you.
          spot: Have a spotter
          spot_p1_html: To help your friends climb safely, you can offer to be the <i>spotter</i>.
          spot_p2: The spotter redirects the climber's fall to land safely on the crash mat.
          spot_p3: "Careful: don't try to catch the climber yourself, you migh injure yourself!"
          descent: Anticipate the descent
          descent_p1: It can sometimes be tricky to go down from a boulder once you're on top. Check the descent beforehand — especially if you're alone!

        rules: 
          title: Rules of good conduct
          intro: The Wicklow area is a unique and fragile environment. It is important to respect a few rules to protect it.
          chalk: Use chalk sparingly
          chalk_p1: Chalk damages the rock, so use it sparingly. You can instead clean the rock (with a soft brush) to increase friction.
          chalk_p2: When you're done, don't forget to brush the holds (still with a soft brush) to remove any trace.
          clean_shoes: Clean your shoes
          clean_shoes_p1: Sand and dirt under your shoes contribute to polish the rock, which damages it in the long run.
          clean_shoes_p2: Don't forget to clean your shoes with a doormat or a rug before you start climbing.
          rain: No climbing after rain
          rain_p1: The rock in Wicklow is very fragile when wet.
          rain_p2: To avoid damaging the rock and/or breaking holds, it is advisable to wait until the rock is thoroughly dry.
          other_rules: Other rules
          other_rules_item1: Walk on existing trails (the wildlife and plants will thank you!)
          other_rules_item2: Carry your crash mat rather than dragging it on the ground
          other_rules_item3: Take your trash with you (and why not pick up any you find along the way?)
          other_rules_item4: Do not build fires, do not smoke
          other_rules_item5_html: Camp only on authorized sites (it is <a href="%{path}" target="_blank">forbidden to park</a> in all parking areas from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM)
