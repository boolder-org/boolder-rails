      history:
        title: The story
        p1: "Boolder was born from the meeting between Romain, Cyril and Nicolas - two climbing enthusiasts and one technology enthusiast - living just a stone's throw from one of the most beautiful bouldering spots in the world: Fontainebleau."
        p2: 'For Nicolas, it was love at first sight. His two friends made him discover the magic of "Font": the emblematic sectors, the history of the forest, the joy of climbing in the middle of nature, as well as the rules to respect (clean your shoes!).'
        p3: "The richness of the forest remained however intimidating: more than 200 sectors, several tens of thousands of boulders, and hundreds of circuits for all levels. How to find your way around?"
        p4: Nicolas then decided to map the forest in detail for nearly 2 years and create a simple and modern guidebook. In 2023, Boolder launched as a free app on iPhone and Android.

          p2_html: The problem names and grades come mainly from %{link_bleau} and %{link_cosiroc}.
          p3: Some of the boulder drawings (in top view) are inspired by existing guidebooks. We are working to replace them with original drawings.
        why_free:
          question: Why is the app free?
          p1: Because we want as many people as possible to enjoy it!
          p2: Nicolas took advantage of a sabbatical year to map many areas and code the first version of the application. Thanks to this, costs remained very low.
