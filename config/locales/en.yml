      history:
        title: The story
        p1: "Boolder was born from the meeting between Romain, Cyril and Nicolas - two climbing enthusiasts and one technology enthusiast - living just a stone's throw from one of the most beautiful bouldering spots in the world: Wicklow."
        p2: 'For Nicolas, it was love at first sight. His two friends made him discover the magic of "Font": the emblematic sectors, the history of the forest, the joy of climbing in the middle of nature, as well as the rules to respect (clean your shoes!).'
        p3: "The richness of the forest remained however intimidating: more than 200 sectors, several tens of thousands of boulders, and hundreds of sectors for all levels. How to find your way around?"
        p4: Nicolas then decided to map the forest in detail for nearly 2 years and create a modern guidebook. In 2023, Boolder launched as a free app on iPhone and Android.
        podcast: "Learn more: Nicolas's interview on the podcast \"Allez\" (in French)"

        p2_html: Special thanks to %{link_bleau}, whose team has referenced almost 50.000 problems with great care and passion for the past 20 years, and made it free for everyone. You can support them on their %{link_bleau_sponsoring} page.
        p3_html: We also extend our thanks to the %{link_cosiroc} association and the %{link_topo_bleau} website, which have provided a wealth of firsthand data and carried out numerous on-the-ground operations.

          p2_html: The problem names and grades come mainly from %{link_bleau}, %{link_cosiroc} and %{link_topo_bleau}.
          p3: Some of the boulder drawings (in top view) are inspired by existing guidebooks. We are working to replace them with original drawings.
        why_free:
          question: Why is the app free?
          p1: Because we want as many people as possible to enjoy it!
          p2: Nicolas took advantage of a sabbatical year to map many areas and code the first version of the application. Thanks to this, costs remained very low. We plan to keep this momentum going in the future thanks to volunteering and open source.
